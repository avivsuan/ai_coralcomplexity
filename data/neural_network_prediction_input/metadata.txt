Dataset Metadata
Dataset Name Pixel Variation and Coral Complexity Predictions for Patch Reefs

Description This dataset contains pixel variation metrics calculated for entire patch reefs and their corresponding tiles. These metrics serve as input for a neural network model aimed at predicting coral structural complexity metrics for the full patch reef.

Columns

X Identifier for the patch reef.
cell Unique tile identifier within the patch reef.
[Color Channel Columns] Pixel variation metrics for different channels in various color spaces
Example r_PixVar_rgb, g_PixVar_rgb, b_PixVar_rgb for RGB color space.
Example y_PixVar_ycrcb for YCrCb color space.
Example gray_PixVar_grayscale for grayscale values.
Example h_PixVar_hsv, v_PixVar_hsv for HSV color space.
Additional color spaces include Lab, Luv, YUV, XYZ, and their respective channels.
Predicted Complexity Metrics These metrics are derived from the neural network model to estimate structural complexity for entire patch reefs.

Pixel variation metrics are computed from remote sensing imagery of reef tiles.
Complexity predictions are based on a neural network model trained on previously validated underwater survey data.
