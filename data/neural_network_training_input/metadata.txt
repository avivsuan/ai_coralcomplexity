Dataset Metadata
Dataset Name: Pixel Variation and Underwater Survey Metrics for Patch Reefs

Description: This dataset contains pixel variation metrics across various color spaces for individual tiles of patch reefs, alongside structural metrics derived from underwater surveys. It provides a comprehensive representation of reef structural complexity and optical variability.

Columns:

rec: Identifier for the patch reef location.
rep: Tile identifier within the patch reef.
[Color Channel Columns]: Pixel variation for different channels in various color spaces:
Example: r_PixVar_rgb, g_PixVar_rgb, b_PixVar_rgb for RGB color space.
Example: y_PixVar_ycrcb for YCrCb color space.
Example: gray_PixVar_grayscale for grayscale values.
Example: h_PixVar_hsv, v_PixVar_hsv for HSV color space.
Other spaces include Lab, Luv, YUV, XYZ, and their respective channels.
D_sfm: Fractal dimension calculated from underwater surveys, indicating surface complexity.
R_sfm: Rugosity calculated from underwater surveys, representing surface roughness.
H_sfm: Height range calculated from underwater surveys, measuring elevation differences within the area.
Source: This dataset combines remotely sensed imagery and underwater survey data.
