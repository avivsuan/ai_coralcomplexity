Code Name: Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Training and Sensitivity Analysis for Coral Complexity Metrics

Description: This R script trains, evaluates, and performs sensitivity analysis on an artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict coral reef structural complexity metrics (e.g., fractal dimension, rugosity, and height range) based on input features such as pixel variability across color spaces.

Inputs:

Data:
A dataset containing features (e.g., pixel variability) as input and coral complexity metrics (D_sfm, R_sfm, H_sfm) as target variables.
Parameters:
Number of hidden layers and nodes.
Number of epochs for training.
Learning rate and optimization parameters.
Outputs:

Trained ANN Model:
The trained model predicts coral complexity metrics based on input features.
Predictions:
Predictions for test data and their associated mean squared error (MSE).
Sensitivity Analysis:
Insights into the relative importance of input features in predicting target metrics.
Core Functionality:

Data Preprocessing:
Uses scale_data() to normalize data within a range for improved model performance.
ANN Training:
Trains an ANN using the ANN2 library with parameters such as:
Hidden layers and ReLU activation.
Adam optimizer for gradient descent.
Loss function: Squared error.
Model Evaluation:
Calculates MSE for predicted versus actual values for each complexity metric (D_sfm, R_sfm, H_sfm).
Sensitivity Analysis:
Explores feature importance in predicting target variables, aiding in understanding model performance.
