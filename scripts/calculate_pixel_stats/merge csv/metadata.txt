Code Metadata
Code Name: Merging Colorspace Transformation Data into a Unified CSV File

Description: This R script processes and merges pixel variation data from multiple color spaces into a single, unified CSV file. It standardizes and consolidates the data for downstream analysis, such as training machine learning models or conducting statistical assessments.

Inputs:

Input Directory (t_path):
Root directory containing subdirectories for each color space transformation (e.g., gray, hsv, rgb).
Individual CSV Files:
Per-color-space pixel variation data files (e.g., pix_values.csv) located in subdirectories organized by transformations.
Outputs:

Merged CSV File:
Path: Y:/Aviv/ArcGIS/CoralSFM/data/TOT_pix_values.csv
Consolidates all pixel variation metrics across color spaces into a single file.
Reshaped Master CSV File:
Path: C:/Users/Aviv/colorspace/master/TOT_pix_values.csv
Reformats data into a wide format where columns represent individual metrics for each transformation.
